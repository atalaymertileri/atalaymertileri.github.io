I am Atalay Mert Ileri, a Senior Research Associate (Postdoctoral Fellow in US terms) on Concurrent, Distributed and Quantum Programming at University of Oxford. My work focuses on formal verification of software systems using interactive proof assistants. I am currently working with [Prof. Nobuko Yoshida](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/nobuko.yoshida/) on adapting session types to quantum processes as a part of [Mobility Reading Group](https://mrg.cs.ox.ac.uk/). Before joining the University of Oxford, I worked at Kansas State University as a Postdoctoral Fellow with [Prof. Hande McGinty](https://www.cs.ksu.edu/about/people/faculty/mcginty/) as a member of [Koncordant Lab](https://www.koncordantlab.com/). My work in Kansas State University investigated applications of formal verification on deductive reasoning using knowledge graphs. Prior to that, I obtained my Ph.D. from MIT under the supervision of [Prof. Nickolai Zeldovich](https://people.csail.mit.edu/nickolai/) and [Prof. M. Frans Kaashoek](https://people.csail.mit.edu/kaashoek/) in [PDOS group](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/). My PhD work involved formal verification of crash-safe storage systems with nondeterministic behaviors' confidentiality properties.
